# rTorch.examples

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `rTorch.examples` is to show practical examples developed
with the package
[rTorch](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rTorch/index.html). The
vignettes included here were initially part of `rTorch`, but I moved
them to a sseparate package to speed up the proccess of building the
more challenging and newer `rTorch`.

The examples, and vignettes, are simple applications of [PyTorch]() that
I found in the web. Some of the examples are just straight forward
scripts with few PyTorch calls and random generated datasets; other
examples are more ellaborated and require the creation of classes, and
access to relatively heavy datasets.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rTorch.examples from GitHub
with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("f0nzie/rTorch.examples")
```
